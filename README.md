# 701-Final-Project
A simulation study for short and long read sequences to assess the impast of sequencing technology on the accuracy of transposon detection pipelines.

The ShortReads folder contains all the scripts used to process the short read data. Similarly LongReads is the scripts for the long read pipeline. The remaining scripts were used to understand statistics about the input data.
